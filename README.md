# I3G4250D
Very simple library for using the I3G4250D 3 axis gyroscope. 
![](https://www.rutronik24.com/pim/direct/st/small/st-i3g4250d.jpg)

I wrote this library because my development board (STM32F429I-DISC1) uses a I3G4250D gyroscope and I wanted gain some experience in embedded programming.
For more information about the I3G4250D gyroscope see the [datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/i3g4250d.pdf) provided by the manufacturer.

## Features
- Simple reading of raw axes values.
- Reading of scaled axes values.
- Enable different axes to read.
- Set output datarate of the gyroscope
- Highpass filter mode selection
- Gyroscope senstivity selection 

## Usage
[Coming soon]

## Note
This library is a personal project and is in no way intended for production use.
I am always open for feedback, if you see any issues in the code open an issue or continue the development yourself.
